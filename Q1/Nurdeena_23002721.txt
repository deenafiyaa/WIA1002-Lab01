My name is Nurdeena Sofiya with matrix number, 23002721. I am 
majoring in Software Engineering. This is my first time taking the 
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this 
subject. This is because I feel like I could gain valuable knowledge that will benefit me in the future. 
I acquired B+ for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I 
think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order 
to do well in the subject, I will do extra exercises on top of completing every tasks given. Wish me luck!!!

Hii it's me again. Finally, it's th end of the term and DS class has finished!
I think I did good in this course so I'm satisfied as I think my effort has not gone to waste. Afterall, I did my best.
DS has taught me the importance of collaboration and that there is always more to learn.
I got my target grade! I think this is because I tend to do more research and exercises on topics that I'm not quite clear of.
Hence, contributing to clear understanding. However, I do wish I could help my friends more despite busy studying.
